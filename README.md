Repository for Data Scientist's Toolbox course


The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the ability to set up a repository
and add a simple markdown file to it.

The file named "HelloWorld.md" is a requirement of the Data Scientist's Toolbox course.

The file named "MarkDownTest.md" shows my own experimentation with the markdown language.
