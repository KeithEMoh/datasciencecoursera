Repository for Data Scientist's Toolbox course


The porpose of this repository is to demonstrate the ability to set up a repository
and include within it a simple markdown file.

The file named "HelloWorld.md" is a requirement of the Data Scientist's toolbow course.

The file named "MarkDown.md" is my own experimentation with the markdown language.
